# EU261-Compensation-from-Qatar

## About EU261

EU261 is legislation meant to provide compensation to consumers in the face of 'controllable' delays when flying (crew are too hungover to fly etc.). This covers things like last minute cancellations, delays and god forbid - if the flight is overbooked. 

I wont explain much more about whether or not you're eligible. If you've found this page you've likely already checked. [If not I suggest you look through this page](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm). 

## My situation

In my case I was flying from Amsterdam to Auckland, New Zealand via Doha. My **final destination** was Auckland - not Doha. Everything was booked on a single ticket. You can have many airlines on a *single ticket.*

**Single ticket examples**
- AMS to Doha to Brisbane with Qatar, Brisbane to Auckland with Air New Zealand. 
- AMS to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong to Auckland with Air New Zealand. 

The trouble starts in Amsterdam, when Schiphol provided a broken air conditioning unit for the plane. The plane was at the correct gate but pushing 35 degrees inside the cabin. The aircraft needed to be moved with working air conditioning. 

- This created a four hour delay in Amsterdam.
- In Doha, I missed my two hour connection to Auckland
- I spent 26 hours in Doha waiting for the next flight. 
	- Qatar provided a hotel for me, transfers and food.
- I arrived into Auckland 27 hours late.

It took a total of 88 days from my first complaint about EU261 to receiving my 600€ compensation. 
## My thoughts on the process

- **The process feels deliberately vague.** **There should be a dedicated EU261 flow provided by Qatar.**  Step one is to 'submit feedback' via a web form. I am not submitting feedback, I maintaining my rights as a traveller to compensation in a controllable delay. 
- **The process takes too long.** It took 88 days from when I submitted feedback. A complaint to the national authorities. A follow up email and a follow up phone call to get it sorted out. 
	-  If I had of not followed up via a phone call I think I would still be waiting for Qatar to get back to me.
- **I could have made the process faster by phoning earlier.** That was when the ball actually got rolling. 
- Although, **I should not need to follow up with Qatar** - there should be established flows and systems for dealing with EU261 complaints that do not take 88 days. 
- I wish that the complaint to the national authorities was personally helpful. Rather than just looking for large numbers of complaints. This makes it easy for airlines to ignore individual and small numbers of complaints. 

## Steps for compensation

Getting compensation from Qatar has not been easy. The process feels like it is designed to make you give up. An easier option would be to use a service like AirHelp - but they take a 33% commission which I do not want to pay. 
### Step zero - Get delayed

And feel confident that you meet the conditions for EU261 compensation - [Check this again to double check](https://europa.eu/youreurope/citizens/travel/passenger-rights/air/index_en.htm). 

### Step one - Make first application

There is no specific 'EU261 complaint' form for now. Qatar Airways does have an EU Passenger Rights web page, but it only links to a help page where you can submit feedback. 

- Visit the [EU air passenger rights](https://www.qatarairways.com/en/legal/eu-air-passenger-rights.html) page
- Submit feedback - include your booking reference/PNR here.

After that:
- Share your feedback with us
- Your travel experience

It is super important that you share your booking reference in this complaint! I'm sure they can find your details via email or name; but this will make it a lot easier to locate the booking. *Your booking reference is also called a **PNR***

I got confirmation email within 10 minutes from Qatar. Things felt promising at this point. **Hold onto that case reference and CRM number**

### Step two - Wait

I waited for 49 days before doing anything else. Realistically I did not expect this to happen instantly. 

### Step three - Follow up email

The automatic confirmation email did not come from a no-reply inbox; it comes from 'tell-us@qatarairways.com.qa' - so I sent a follow up.

### Step four - Complain to the authorities

I did not get a response to my follow up email. At exactly two months I complained to the national authorities. In my case, I was departing from Amsterdam - so I complained to the Dutch authorities. 

==I'm a big believer in that everyone who waits for two months for the airline to reply, should absolutely complain to the authorities. It might end up being no help to you immediately, but it could help other travellers in the future.== 

[Here is a PDF of all the EU national authorities.](https://transport.ec.europa.eu/document/download/d7b5dd33-4083-4faa-8132-b6dc8b3a1c07_en?filename=2004_261_national_enforcement_bodies-2024-01-30.pdf)

The NL authorities do not investigate singular cases; but will investigate the airline as a whole if enough 'signals' aka complaints are received in an undisclosed short period. Apparently. 

### Step five - Call your local Qatar Airways phone number

I tried to contact the WhatsApp support but they are not able to help with much at all. Every time I have contacted them they've either told me to check online, or 'wait' even though I've already been waiting almost three months at this point. They also gave me a Qatari phone number to call for the customer service team. +974-40230000 - with the demise of Skype I've not figured out a way to call international phone numbers yet for near free.

So instead I Googled *"phone number Qatar Airways 'insert country'"*
- Schiphol Airport gave me one phone number. 
- The same phone number was listed in the [Privilege Club Contact List](https://www.qatarairways.com/en/Privilege-Club/contact-us.onboardpopup.html). There should be phone number for everyone to call here. 

Even if you did not join the privilege club; this is the only 'local number' I could find.

I spoke to a lovely woman who wanted to know my *'CRM'* and *'Case Reference'* from Step One.
- She claimed to be from reservations and unable to immediately help. 
- She claimed to escalate the case given it had been near three months.
- She told me I would hear from someone soon
- I asked when I should call back if I have not heard from Qatar Airways
	- She said within 48 hours (!!!)

### Step six - Receive an email from Qatar

42 hours later I had an email from Qatar Customer Care! 

Qatar sent me:
- A PDF form to absolve them of any wrong doing.
- A link to a secure webform to fill in.

There is one giant caveat at this point. **==The form they send is only valid for a small 48 hour window from the time they send it.==** I hope you're not out camping when they send this! You also need access to a printer to manually sign the PDF agreement - digital signings are not acceptable.  I dont have a scanner, I simply took a clear photo of the form.

After filling everything in they advise that payment will be made within 2-4 weeks. A long time when you've already been waiting three months. 

Once submitted it was another wait to see if I would get my 600€. 

### Final Outcome - I got paid! 

2 to 4 weeks was an 'under promise over deliver' statement. I woke up four days later to a notification that Qatar Airways had paid me 600€.
